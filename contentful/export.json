There is a distinction between electronic communication monitoring and intelligence information gathering. What has been seen since September 11th is an increase in the volume and range of those activities, impacting common citizens and threatening journalistic work. In both realities privacy rights are being violated. Big tech platforms still present terms of use that are impossible to not accept, unless one is wanting to become a digital pariah. Hence, people are forced to abdicate their freedom from surveillance. The biggest contradiction is that exercise of rights is no longer indivisible, interrelated and interdependent. And that power concentration is the common challenge for privacy advocates across borders. ",

Jitsi Meet is open-source and operates within your browser, instead of requiring any installation, giving it an edge in ease of use.Unfortunately, this ease of use comes at the cost of privacy. WebRTC, the framework used by Jitsi Meet to enable browser-based real-time communication, does not support end-to-end encryption. This is actually not hugely problematic, as you have the option of hosting a Jitsi conference on a server you own or control, but self-hosting may prove too cumbersome for many use cases.Although Jitsi products do not have the slickest UI on the market, they offer all the functionality of large competitors for free, with a level of potential security that far-exceeds most other video conferencing and collaboration platforms, due to the possibility of hosting one’s own instance of the Jitsi server. And if you’re worried about limitations on how many people can join your meeting, don’t be. The amount of people who can participate in a video conference using Jitsi Meet is only limited by your available CPU power and bandwidth.",

In addition, it proposed alarming prohibitions, among which were to publish any type of information, photos or videos of a person without their express or written consent, which is impractical for legitimate or non-harmful uses, including investigative journalistic work. The Bill also sought to prohibit people from “exposing” their own sensitive or intimate information on social networks and to prohibit behaviors impossible to supervise without violating the privacy of searches on a massive scale. For example, it sanctioned the free and gratuitous downloading of contents protected by copyright (ignoring that they could be freely accessible) or the access to “inappropriate” or illegal contents.",

Yes, there is potential for ‘surveillance beacons’ to be set up by the health system so they can work out who stood next to a fixed position for more than 15 minutes — but this is ridiculous, if the governments want to know where you are, they can just ask your phone company. Realistically, you’re taking a risk every time you download an app. Just owning a phone is a privacy risk. In the age of Google Maps, Siri, Facebook Pixel, Fitbit, and metadata retention, I really don’t think COVIDSafe even deserves a mention in the 2020 Top 500 list of apps and services that seriously expose users to privacy risks.

Non-citizens wanting to work have to request a rarely granted special visa through their home country’s embassy or else be considered “illegal migrants” on arrival.

There is, however, no clarity about the nature and depth of said training or the amount of expert forensic officers currently authorised to perform such evaluations. As of now matches yielded by this system can’t be considered conclusive proof, but only circumstantial, they can nevertheless point a disproportionate amount of attention towards already vulnerable segments of the population largely without criminal records.",

Lots of discussion has gone into how social media companies are contributing to the age of misinformation, and how to reverse the trend. Early on, regulators hoped content moderation would be the answer —  but it’s clear that content moderation isn’t an effective solution (at least, not on its own). Now, the conversation has turned — and people are exploring whether making changes to social media algorithms could get to the heart of the problem. ",

Those means—which encompass everything from colossal server infrastructure to swathes of engineers building products—are overwhelmingly controlled by the biggest players in the game. This takes away the ability of the user (that’s you, by the way) to control how they experience the internet, removes the user’s power to make meaningful choices about the conditions they expect when living their digital lives, and forces someone else’s (self-serving) vision of the internet on the masses.",

Because such drastic changes are needed, there might be some growing pains along the way, but work is needed to break the inertia of the market and push us towards a better, more democratic internet. The hailed saviour is web3, but the concept of web3 isn’t infallible or incorruptible either. At the start, web2 was also extremely idealistic, optimistic, and hopeful about how it would help the world, but over time its flaws have become plain for anyone to see. It’s important that we don’t let web3 get hijacked by the same power brokers that puppeteered their way up to the top of the web2 ladder. In fact, web3 shouldn’t really have a ladder at all. ",

Firstly, there is control over the software itself—the webpage you visit, the application you download, etc. The best tool we have for spreading and sharing control over software is through open-sourcing. Open-sourcing not only allows users to contribute directly to the software and create the changes they want to see, it also allows people to effectively xerox the project and start again if they see the software becoming too divergent from the interests of its users, or if different subsets of its users have different needs (after all, how can one tool be ‘right’ for billions of people). This also allows for more open, honest, and transparent discussions from anyone in the community who wishes to participate — even if they can’t write a single line of code. Secondly, there is control over infrastructure — an abstraction of all the server racks, cables, network connections, storage servers, etc. Democratising control over infrastructure is a lot more challenging than the software, because it requires users to have the technical and monetary resources to contribute to operating network infrastructure. However, the work of engineers can make it simpler for the average user of the internet to participate in operating server infrastructure and demystifying the role of infrastructure operators to give users more agency and control. ",

And, when it comes to digital trust, generally the best we should expect from technology is an “assurance,” the presence of which is a requirement of trust, but itself not a replacement for the act of trusting. At the same time it’s really important for digital technologies to help us place trust, an active verb, in the publications we read, the institutions we transact with and the people we talk to.",

In recent times, there has been significant pressure from the judiciary as well as other actors, including voices from civil society, to create a strong law. At the same time, there has been greater recognition of privacy as a social and economic good. The series of data protection drafts set a poor example by equating the protection of privacy and personal data, which derives its origin from the positive right to privacy, with policy objectives influenced by political economy considerations such as ‘a free and fair digital economy’ (2018 draft), ‘interest and security of the state’, and the need for ‘norms for social media intermediaries’ (2021 draft). While it is entirely within the remit of the legislature and the executive to pursue policy objectives through laws and policies, it is unusual to see such considerations dominating the positive rights obligations of the state in legislation intended to directly discharge them. There is a need to see the privacy of the citizens as the primary end goal of data protection legislation.",

He expressed concern that the balance between security and usability tends to tip too far towards security, at the expense of these tools being usable. Suelette added that without a focus on usability, security technologies simply won’t see wide adoption.

Everyone concurred that there is a lack of diversity in both the supply and receipt of funding in the secure tech space. Eric noted that the vast majority of funding in the space comes from the US, and consequently, the majority of grantees are also from the US, creating a highly anglo-centric sector. Suelette said she would like to see Asia entering the space, while Eric noted it would be good to see more activity from donors in India.

Obviously a worthwhile message to send to young teens, but those pleas were drowned out by the cacophony of likes, shares, and DMs that greeted us the second we walked out of the school gymnasium and unlocked our phones. There’s no doubt that the hyper-stimulating nature of social media worsens online disinhibition, and as the almighty algorithms get better at feeding us content that manipulates us, impacts us, and outrages us — the problem is getting worse.

Here’s where anonymity comes in: anonymity is being stuck up as the boogeyman behind toxic online disinhibition.

The next leap of logic: if we remove anonymity, it will reduce the amount of hate, disinformation, and abuse that we experience online.

Furthermore, there were also a number of cases where administrators of various Telegram channels or groups were belatedly arrested, charged and sentenced to hefty jail time for “inciting riots” during the 2019 protests(13). All these have added to the silencing of critics in Hong Kong, as a mood of self-censorship has settled in. ",

In addition to further stifling any shred of independent journalism and press freedom remaining in Hong Kong, such law may finally completely silence the users on social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as messaging platforms, like WhatsApp and Telegram, while putting those platform companies in the untenable position of having to carry out government censorship. ",

But Russia recently enacted a law to ban “false information,” such as calling its Ukraine invasion a “war,” with a punishment of up to 15 years in prison. This is similar to Beijing’s strategy in Hong Kong. In the long run, sadly, Hong Kong is undoubtedly treading toward the model of outright China-styled censorship and surveillance. ",

The maximum sentence for the aggravated offense for illegal interference with computer data and a computer system may even be life imprisonment. In short, these proposed changes are about easier prosecution and harsher punishment. ",

There are several reasons for the rush for new laws. Such laws targeting cybersecurity, misinformation and also cyber and data sovereignty have already been established in many other parts of the world. In Asia alone, similar laws have appeared in Vietnam, Singapore, Indonesia, India and, of course, China itself, are becoming the norm, putting pressure on freedom of expression for both the users as well as the social media or messaging platforms. Even western democracies are doing the same, and it has become very easy for autocratic regimes to justify their digital repression by claiming to be, first, targeting cyber-crimes and protecting cybersecurity, and, second, that they are only following the examples of western democracies.",

While the public often asks whether the social media platform, such as Facebook in this case, may have provided information and data to the police, the reality is that the police may not bother with getting such data from social media platforms. Everything is already sitting on the phones and computers of those arrested for the police to harvest.  In this regard, the users’ devices remain the weakest link when it comes to law enforcement abuse. Meanwhile, a number of other Facebook “secrets” pages were “voluntarily” removed to avoid getting their administrators into trouble.",

What stands out for Hong Kong is only how far it has fallen in such a short period of time, from a relatively free society with a vibrant press and civil society, to a highly repressive regime. May this be a reminder for the rest of the world of the fragility of online freedom of expression, how easily it can be lost. ",

The “Oxen” protocol is defined in a whitepaper which outlines the structure and function of the network on a broad conceptual level.

The ‘oxen-io/oxen-core’ software is completely open-source, and is made available for anyone to use WITHOUT WARRANTY. It is left to users of the software to review its code, assess its strengths, weaknesses, and security, and determine the software’s suitability for their use cases. Contributors and distributors of this software cannot be held liable for any loss incurred in association with its use.The ‘github.com/oxen-io/oxen-core’ software is currently the only known software that is compatible with the “Oxen” network. However, anyone is able to create alternative implementations of the Oxen protocol, whether these alternative distributions are based on the existing software or not. So long as the rules of the network are followed, users of alternative software distributions can interact with other users on the “Oxen” network without restriction.At times, the users of the “Oxen” network may decide to change the network rules in order to meet some end. Such changes are often referred to as a ‘hardfork’ or similar, and if successful, they will render older software versions (or incompatible alternative versions) non-functional on the new network. These changes are substantiated by the community infrastructure providers of “Oxen”. Users should familiarise themselves with the hard-fork process present in many cryptocurrency projects before using the “Oxen” software.",

For example, if there are an average of 450 nodes on the network over a 30 day period, the Foundation will run no more than 45 nodes. This limit effectively means that the Foundation will be collecting 20% of the block reward, between its 10% share of the Service Node network, and the standard 10% governance reward.The Foundation uses the same software as is publicly available on the oxen-io/oxen-core GitHub repository.",

Flaws in exchange software or flaws in the underlying Oxen software may result in losses by users of these exchanges. At present, NO marketplace exists for Oxen that is regulated or protected by governments in any way.

This is because a view key only allows you to see incoming transactions. Due to the nature of transactions in Oxen (inherited from Monero), most outgoing transactions send more than the desired amount, and the remaining change is then sent back to the original address. The amount returned is considered an incoming transaction. Because the view key does not allow you to see outgoing transactions, the premine wallet balance will appear larger than it is in reality.The network was bootstrapped and mined for approximately an hour before the code was released. The first publicly minable block was block 154. All 154 premined blocks were mined to a wallet controlled by the OPTF Ltd. The reason that the software was not immediately released upon the network’s creation was to ensure that the network was stable and that transfers were working between Foundation wallets. Though fairly inconsequential compared to the rest of the premine, the coins mined from these 154 blocks (approx 18,800 Oxen) will be put to good use, as determined by the board of the Foundation in accordance with its constitution.Every Oxen block contains three outputs. One goes to the miner who constructs the block, the next to a random Service Node, and the last to the Governance wallet specified in the code. Other nodes check that this output was sent to the right place as a consensus rule. Auditors can check the Governance block reward wallet with the same patch to see incoming block rewards equal to 5% of the expected block reward.",
